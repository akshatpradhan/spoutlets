  How's it going, Doctor?
</p>
<p>
  Iâ€™d like you to integrate my journal and mood chart into my treatment. I think it will help me a lot if you reviewed them for our next meeting.
</p>
<p>This is a sample of my journal :</p>
<ul>
  <% @resource.invited_by.entries.limit(5).each do |entry| %>
    <li><%= entry.content %></li>
  <% end -%>
</ul>
<p>
  Please accept my invitation to get secure access to my journal entries.
</p>
<p><%= link_to 'Accept invitation', accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token) %></p>
<p>If you don't want to accept the invitation, please ignore this email.<br />
Your account won't be created until you set your password.</p>

  Thanks,
</p>
<p>
  Your Client
